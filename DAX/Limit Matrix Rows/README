# Limit Matrix Rows in Power BI Using DAX

![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)

## ðŸ§  Context
This example shows how to **limit the number of rows displayed in a Power BI Matrix** when your main value is a **measure** (not a column).  
It's a common case in dashboards where you only want to display the **Top N categories** based on a KPI such as sales, revenue, or in this example, the number of courses.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To display only the **Top 10 rows** in a matrix visual, based on a DAX measure, using the functions `RANKX`, `ALLSELECTED`, and `IF`.

---

## ðŸ§© Solution Overview
Power BI does not allow you to directly limit the number of rows in a matrix when values are measures.  
To achieve this, we create **three measures** and use a **visual-level filter**:

1. **Main measure (e.g. Sales, Courses, etc.)**
2. **Ranking measure** to calculate row order
3. **Filter measure** to display only Top N rows

---

## ðŸ’» DAX Implementation

```DAX
-- Measure 1: Total value per item (example: total courses or total sales)
N_corsi = SUM('Courses'[NumeroCorsi])

-- Measure 2: Rank rows based on the measure
RowRank =
RANKX(
    ALLSELECTED('Courses'),
    [N_corsi],
    ,
    DESC,
    DENSE
)

-- Measure 3: Display only the top 10 rows
ShowTopN =
IF(
    [RowRank] <= 10,
    1,
    0
)
```

### âœ… How to apply in Power BI
1. Create or select your **Matrix** visual.  
2. Place your fields in rows (e.g. Category â†’ Product).  
3. Add your measure (e.g. `[N_corsi]`) in **Values**.  
4. Add the measure `[ShowTopN]` to **Filters on this visual**.  
5. Set the filter to **Show items when ShowTopN = 1**.

## ðŸ“Š Example

| Category | Title     | N_corsi |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| A         | Course 1   | 10      |
| A         | Course 2   | 15      |
| B         | Course 3   | 20      |
| ...       | ...        | ...     |

After applying the filter, only the **Top 10 rows** (based on N_corsi) will appear.

---

## ðŸ’¬ Key Concepts
- **RANKX**: ranks each row based on a chosen measure.
- **ALLSELECTED**: ensures the rank respects user filters in the report.
- **Visual filters**: allow you to hide non-top rows dynamically.

## ðŸ§© Difficulty
**3 / 10 (Easy)**  
A beginner-friendly example demonstrating a common Power BI pattern.  
Perfect for learning how to combine ranking logic and visual filtering.
